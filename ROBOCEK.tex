\section{Down the Memory Lane}

A vibrant team of young enthusiasts from GCEK inspired from a group of students from Chennai fabricated a small team with one dream to excel in the field of robotics. They named it \textit{\textbf{'Robotic Enthusiasts Of GCEK'}}. They hanged on to their dream of a robotics club for GCEK till it attained its official recognition on 30th January, 2014.

Robocek gradually evolved from a handful of members with no background in robotics into one of the most highly acclaimed robotics club in Kerala with a dedicated team and unmatched performance. The hardcore activities were accomplished by the students who organised themselves into an Executive Committee with prominent guidance from the Staff Advisors. They realised the dream of a room dedicated to Robocek in GCEK. They conceived the idea of a basic workshop that would pave a path into the realm of robotics under ROBOCEK and finally converged to \textit{'ACTUATOR',The Beginner's Workshop}. Bit by bit 'Actuator' turned to be the first and the most interesting workshop that waved among the freshers of GCEK and also any entry point into the ROBOCEK. The pioneers into the club slowly engaged themselves into learning in groups.\\
The dedicated cluster of students strived to explore the intangible sphere of robotics through workshops, competitions, collaborative learning and expeditions nurturing academic excellence endeavouring to keep in pace with electronics and robotics. A lot of activities like major tech fests and robofests including Xplore 19, Avega 2020 by Robocek were greatly appreciated. Other activites like expo's,flood relief activities, workshops etc were also organised from time to time.
