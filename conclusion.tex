Robotics is indeed a vast field that experience rapid advancements every day. It finds is usages ranging from home appliances to commercial factories. Technology have made possible for a large population of enthusiasts to test and build new ideas to uplift human lifestyle. Introducing Arduino and its working can stand as foundational steps into robotics. \ac{IoT} and embedded project contributes heavily to automation of various facilities. A wide range of projects can be found at Hackster \url{https://www.hackster.io/} that make use of basic units to build amazing ideas. Higher to Arduino, Raspberry Pi scores the most when it comes to higher \ac{IoT} and other projects. Image processing, Voice controller applications, surveillance, automation etc demands Open Source platforms like raspberry pi. Other software's and advancements keeps on progressing as we speak! As the technology improves, there will be new ways to use robots which will bring new hopes and new potentials.
